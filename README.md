## Design and Clean Code
The goal of this project is to make a similar site to facebook, with my own unique visual aesthetic and shortcuts. I aim to create a sleek, clean design and work to keep my code clean and readable. I will be using comments to help make reading my code easier. This is a personal project, not meant for a production environment.
