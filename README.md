# facebook-clone
Page created to practice fundamentals

## Design and Clean Code
The goal of this project is to make a similar site to facebook, with my own unique visual aesthetic and shortcuts. I aim to create a sleek, clean design and work to keep my code clean and readable. I will be using comments to help make reading my code easier. This is a personal project, not meant for a production environment. 

## Design the webpage for multiple screen sizes and orientations
Because so many people use phones or tablets to view media, along with the usual computer browsers, I want to ensure that this site runs well on all devices. I plan to make a computer site first, and then adjust from there.
